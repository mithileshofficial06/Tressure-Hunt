/**
 * The Mystery Room.
 *
 * An antique room with five clues hidden in it, a rail of five locked sections
 * down the right-hand side, and a console along the bottom. Every clue, once
 * solved, spells a word out *in the room* — developed on paper, printed on a
 * page, written in a web, thrown on the floor in light. The player reads that
 * word, types it into the console, and the matching section opens and shows
 * its share of the reveal code. All five open, and the room hands
 * `CODES.room` up to the shell.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF STATE, and the difference matters:
 *
 *   `read`   — the clue has been solved in the world. This is what keeps a
 *              revealed thing revealed: the board stays developed, the book
 *              re-opens straight to its page, the web stays across the bench,
 *              the stags stay lit. It never unlocks anything by itself.
 *   `opened` — the word has been typed into the console. This, and only this,
 *              is what opens a section and what decides whether the room is
 *              solved.
 *
 * Keeping them apart is what makes the console a real step rather than
 * decoration. It also means a team can solve the clues in any order, walk away,
 * and come back to type — and that a coordinator watching the screen can see
 * the difference between "they found it" and "they entered it".
 *
 * Sections are not gated on each other. Five people round one laptop do not
 * search in the order an author imagined, and a puzzle that insists on an order
 * mostly produces a queue.

              Making the viewport bigger multiplied the cost of every pixel
              decision that had been getting away with it at 640px, and the room
              went from smooth to visibly laggy. Three defaults were doing the
              damage, and all three are wrong for this scene specifically:

              `dpr` defaults to the display's own pixel ratio. On a 2x laptop
              panel that is four times the fragment work for a scene whose art
              is flat-shaded primitives with a halftone screen printed over the
              top — there is no detail in it that survives to reward the extra
              pixels. Capped at 1.5, which still looks sharp on a projector and
              is the single biggest win available here.

              `antialias` defaults to on. MSAA over a canvas this size is not
              cheap, and the halftone overlay is already dithering every edge in
              the room; the aliasing it would fix is not visible through it.

              `powerPreference` defaults to letting the browser choose, which on
              a laptop with switchable graphics means the integrated GPU. This
              is the one thing on the page and it should get the real one. */}

 * WHAT THIS BUYS. Shadows are a second render of every shadow-casting object in
 * the room, from the light's point of view, and measurement put that at 418 of
 * the room's 1221 draw calls per frame — a third of all the work, repeated
 * sixty times a second to produce an image that is identical every time. The
 * room is a room: the walls, the desk, the cabinets, the crates and the shelves
 * do not move, and the one light that casts shadows is bolted to the ceiling.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY. Things that move after the freeze keep the
 * shadow they had when it happened — an opened drawer casts its closed shadow.
 * That is a real artefact and the reason to know about it. It survives here
 * because of what this particular room looks like: one soft ceiling spot at
 * high penumbra, over furniture, in a scene whose actual light comes from
 * coloured point lights that never cast at all. The moving things are small
 * (a drawer front, a book, a 5cm cartridge) and their shadows are diffuse
 * enough at that penumbra that there is nothing legible to go stale.
 *
 * The warm-up is frames rather than a timer because what has to be finished is
 * a render, not an interval — materials compile lazily on first sight, and a
 * shadow map frozen before the room has been drawn once is a blank one.
