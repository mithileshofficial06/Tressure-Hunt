/**
 * The five locked sections of the Mystery Room, and the codes that open them.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE ROOM. The player walks an antique room looking for clues.
 * Each clue, when solved, spells a word out *in the room* — on paper, on a
 * page, in a web, in a beam of light. The player reads that word and types it
 * into the console under the viewport. A correct word unlocks the matching
 * section in the task rail, and the section then shows its share of the reveal
 * code. Five sections open, and the room hands `CODES.room` to the shell.
 *
 * Sections are opened BY THE CODE, not in order. A team that stumbles on the
 * stags before they ever find the torch can type ANTLERS and open section 4
 * first; nothing gates anything else. That is deliberate — five people crowded
 * round one laptop will not search in the order the author imagined, and a
 * puzzle that insists on an order mostly produces a queue.
 *
 * WHY THE CODES ARE IN THE BUNDLE. For the same reason `CODES.room` is (see
 * codes.ts and spec 2.1): the anti-cheat model is a team typing an answer while
 * a coordinator watches, not hiding strings from a browser that has to render
 * them. Every one of these words is drawn somewhere in the 3D scene, so it is
 * in the bundle whatever this file does. What makes the room worth playing is
 * the work of finding them.

   * to and then abandoned them there. The clue that actually unsticks people is
   * never "where" — it is "what you are looking at is not doing what you think".
   *
   *   [0] WHERE. Names the place. Enough to walk to, useless for solving.
   *   [1] HOW. The one property of the thing that a player will not work out by
   *       clicking harder — that the ink needs a colour of light, that the book
   *       is upside down, that the rack has a spec card, that one stag over is
   *       nothing, that the four faces have an order.
   *
   * Never the answer itself, and never the sequence of clicks. The second clue
   * removes the guessing, not the doing. It matters most on the fluid bench,
   * where a wrong guess destroys a cartridge for good and there is now no visual
   * tell at all — that task is unfair without its second clue and fair with it.
